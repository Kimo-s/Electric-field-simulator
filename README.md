# Electric-field-simulator
An electric field simulator written in python. It simulates the electric field strength and direction for various points on the screen and allows many charges to add up.

Note: The program is currently not optimized but I will be implementing threads into it in the near future. I will also add some UI to make it easier to control the charges and add or remove charges. Adjusting, adding and removing obstacles will be implemented eventually
